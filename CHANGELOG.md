## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **GSHP never heated and metered 0 kWh.** The `gshp` air component derives its mode from `outlet_temp_setpoint` vs inlet temperature, but the PSZ signal builder only drove setpoints on components whose *name* contained "heat"/"cool", so a GSHP kept its 13 °C default and sat in cooling all winter (`examples/residential_gshp.yaml`: 5,994 unmet heating hours). Its compressor power was then dropped from the annual summary because end-use bucketing is by name substring (upstream #74). Now: the PSZ builder drives any `gshp` component to the heating DAT / cooling SAT / off per loop mode; the component treats the ±99 °C off-sentinels as Off (previously 99 °C meant "heat to 99 °C"); and snapshot power is keyed `"<name> [gshp heating|cooling]"` from the thermal-output sign so it lands in Heating (Electric) / Cooling (Electric) and in submeters. Residential example after the fix: 2,589 kWh heating electric, 194 kWh cooling electric, 67 unmet heating hours. Still open (upstream #56): no part-load cycling penalty on the GSHP, `eir_ft` applied as a COP multiplier.

### Added
- **`--timeseries` flag** (`openbse-cli`) — opt-in switch to write the full per-timestep results CSV (one row per timestep, one column per component output).

### Changed
- **Per-timestep results CSV is now opt-in** (`openbse-cli`) — the large `*_results.csv` (which can reach hundreds of MB for big annual models and whose write can take longer than the simulation itself) is no longer written by default. Pass `--timeseries` to restore it. The summary report (`*_summary.txt` / `.html` / `.csv`) is still always written and carries the annual/monthly energy totals most callers need.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **Energy End-Use Dashboard** (`tools/editor`) — New ⚡ Energy tab shows a monthly stacked bar chart and annual summary table for electricity, natural gas, district heat/cool end uses. Zone-level unmet heating/cooling hours displayed with per-zone breakdown when any zone exceeds zero. Reads site-level `*_kwh` columns from the loaded results CSV automatically. SI (kWh) and IP (kBtu) unit systems supported. Closes #24.
- **HVAC network expanded** (`tools/editor`) — `NetworkView` now renders `evap_cooler` (sublabel from mode), `vrf_outdoor_unit`, `vrf_indoor_unit`, `radiant_panel` (sublabel from source) on the air-side graph and `thermal_storage` (sublabel shows type + strategy), `gshp` on the plant-side graph. `dual_duct_box` labeled "Dual Duct Box" in terminal nodes. All new types have distinct Tokyo Night theme colors and 20×20 SVG icons. Closes #24.
- **View Report button** (`tools/editor`) — Results toolbar "View Report" button locates the `*_summary.html` file next to the active CSV and opens it in the default browser via a new `open_in_browser` Tauri command. Shows an inline message if no report is found. Closes #24.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Setpoint reset controls** — OA-based and demand-based SAT reset on `AirLoopControls` (`cooling_sat_reset`, `heating_sat_reset`); OA-based plant loop setpoint reset on `PlantLoopInput` (`setpoint_reset`). Closes #32.
- **Evaporative cooling** — `EvapCooler` component with `direct`, `indirect`, and `two_stage` modes. Integrated as air-loop equipment via `type: evap_cooler`. Closes #33.
- **Thermal energy storage** — `ThermalStorage` plant component with `chilled_water` and `ice` types. `full_storage`, `load_leveling`, and `demand_limiting` control strategies. Standby loss via `loss_ua`. Closes #37.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Dual-duct CAV system** — `system_type: dual_duct` with `DualDuctBox` mixing box terminals. Hot and cold deck supply temperatures blend per zone proportionally to load. Autosizing, parametric override support. See `examples/office_dual_duct.yaml`. Closes #13.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Ground-source heat pump (GSHP)** — New `GroundSourceHeatPump` component (`gshp.rs`). Uses Kusuda-Achenbach ground temperature equation as the entering water temperature (EWT) instead of a condenser water loop. Three ground temp source modes: `auto` (derives mean/amplitude/phase from hourly EPW data), `epw_monthly` (uses EPW header ground temperature table when available, falls back to `auto`), `monthly` (user-supplied 12-value table [°C]). Separate `rated_cooling_capacity` and `rated_heating_capacity` with `autosize` support. Optional capacity/EIR performance curves (`cap_ft`, `eir_ft`). Compressor energy routed to `cooling_electric` end-use. See `examples/residential_gshp.yaml`. Closes #12.

### Added
- **Table-lookup performance curves** — `PerformanceCurve::TableLookup` variant accepts manufacturer tabular data directly (no polynomial fitting). N-linear interpolation, per-axis `hold_edge`/`linear` extrapolation, optional output clamping. Axis variables are named (`outdoor_dry_bulb`, `part_load_ratio`, etc.) — order-independent and validated against slot type contracts at parse time. Closes #30.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **VRF systems** — `VrfOutdoorUnit` coordinates multiple `VrfIndoorUnit` fan-coil units per zone. Performance curves f(outdoor T, indoor T). Heat recovery mode routes cooling rejection to heating zones, reducing compressor work. Capacity limiting with proportional PLR scaling. See `examples/office_vrf.yaml`. Closes #10.
- **Radiant panels** — `RadiantPanel` component supporting fin-tube radiators, panel radiators, and chilled ceiling panels. Hot-water, chilled-water, and electric sources. Configurable `radiant_fraction` (default 0.50 for heating, 0.70 for cooling). Radiant portion distributed to zone surfaces via area×absorptance, affecting MRT. New `radiant_gains` field on `ZoneHvacConditions`. Closes #11.
- **HAMT moisture transport** — 1D finite-difference coupled heat-and-moisture solver. Activated per-construction when all material layers have `vapor_resistance_factor` and `sorption_isotherm` defined; falls back to CTF otherwise. New material fields: `vapor_resistance_factor`, `sorption_isotherm`, `liquid_transport_coeff`. Closes #5.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **DX coil dehumidification** — `autocalculate_shr` now defaults to `true` for all DX coils. Supply air humidity ratio is wired into `ZoneHvacConditions` so dehumidified coil outlet air correctly updates the zone moisture balance each timestep. Closes #7.
- **Humidity-based controls** — `max_relative_humidity` and `min_relative_humidity` setpoints on zones (%). When zone RH exceeds the max, dehumidification mode activates the DX coil even without sensible cooling demand. When RH drops below the min, the humidifier activates. Closes #15.
- **Multi-speed and variable-speed DX coils** — `CoolingCoilDXMultiSpeed` with per-speed `DXSpeedStage` entries (capacity, COP, SHR, performance curves). Two-speed control selects low/high stage based on sensible load; variable-speed interpolates capacity and COP between bounding stages. Use `source: dx_multispeed` in YAML. Closes #6.
- **Water-source heat pump (WSHP)** — New `WaterSourceHeatPump` component (`wshp.rs`). Performance curves as f(entering water temp, entering air temp). Heat rejection/absorption is energy-balanced for both heating (extracts from water loop) and cooling (rejects to water loop) modes. Connects to a condenser water plant loop. Use `source: wshp` in YAML. Closes #9.
- **Chiller lead/lag sequencing** — `staging_mode: sequential` (default, already working) or `equal_split` on `PlantLoopInput`. Sequential fills each unit to capacity before staging the next; equal split divides load evenly. Optional `staging_threshold` (default 0.9) prevents premature lag-chiller starts in sequential mode. Closes #14.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **PTHP system type** — `system_type: pthp` adds packaged terminal heat pump support: heat pump heating coil with ON/OFF PLR cycling (same as DX cooling, not PLR=1 water-coil modulation). Existing `HeatingCoilInput` with `source: heat_pump` wires directly in. Includes `examples/hotel_pthp.yaml`. Closes #8.
- **Advanced economizer modes** — Three new `EconomizerType` variants available in all system types (PSZ-AC and VAV): `fixed_enthalpy` (OA when outdoor enthalpy < configurable limit, default 65.2 kJ/kg), `enthalpy_with_high_limit` (differential enthalpy AND dry-bulb high-limit). Also fixes `differential_enthalpy` which was incorrectly comparing temperatures instead of enthalpies. Closes #16.
- **ComponentKind enum** — All HVAC components now implement `component_kind() -> ComponentKind` on the `AirComponent` and `PlantComponent` traits, enabling type-safe energy accounting without string matching. Closes #23.
- **`docs/CONTRIBUTING_COMPONENTS.md`** — Step-by-step guide for adding new physics components: trait implementation, YAML registration, sign conventions, unit reference table, and a worked example. Closes #23.
- **Zone air balance diagnostic outputs** — New per-zone output variables `q_surf_conv_total`, `q_surf_conv_walls`, `q_surf_conv_floors`, `q_surf_conv_roofs`, `q_surf_conv_windows`, `q_infiltration_sensible`, and `q_thermal_mass` expose each term of the zone air energy balance for validation and debugging.
- **Per-surface convection outputs** — `conv_to_zone` (h_conv × A × ΔT) and `h_conv_inside` are now available as surface-level output variables.
- **`compare_zone_balance.py`** — Zone air balance comparison script for Single Family prototype (OB vs E+ component-by-component).

### Fixed

- **Inter-floor slab solar interaction (Single Family prototype)** — The 1F/2F structural deck was modeled as an adiabatic surface, causing `FullExterior` solar distribution to send ~50% of beam solar to it. Since both faces are in the same zone the surface is adiabatic, so all absorbed energy recycled back to zone air with no loss path — an artificial gain loop not present in E+. Converted to `internal_mass` (matching E+'s approach): thermal mass is preserved, solar distribution is excluded. Heating error vs E+ reduced from +18% to +4.8%; cooling from unconstrained to +3.5%. Closes #18.
- **`differential_enthalpy` economizer** — Was comparing outdoor dry-bulb temperature against return air temperature instead of computing and comparing air enthalpies. Now correctly uses h = cp·T + hfg·w.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **ASHRAE 140 CI regression gate** — All 63 ASHRAE 140-2023 cases run on every push/PR; CI fails if any currently-passing case regresses.

### Fixed

- `build_140_csv.py` column matching for free-float and sun zone temperatures broken by output format changes.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Output variable customization** — Outputs can now be specified for 'all' relevant parameters (zones, surfaces, components, etc) within the Workbench editor.  Note that the drop down menu functionality is not yet integrated and so requires manual text entry.


## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Parametric run engine** — Execute multiple simulation runs with parameter overrides from a single YAML file. Supports scalar overrides on any named component field (`"Boiler-1.efficiency": 0.95`), per-run weather file swaps, and automatic sweep expansion with zip or Cartesian product modes. Each run produces a separate results CSV.
- **Sweep syntax** — Auto-generate parametric runs from `values: [0.80, 0.85, 0.90]` lists or `range: { min: 3.0, max: 5.0, step: 0.5 }` specifications. Combine multiple sweeps with `cross_product: true` for full factorial analysis.
- **Section override scaffolding** — Data structures and YAML parsing for future template-based section replacement (`include:` with `replaces:` lists). Execution not yet implemented.
